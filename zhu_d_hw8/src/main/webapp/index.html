For selfnote only:

local test link:
http://localhost:8080/zhu_d_hw8/MyServlet

scp zhu_d_hw8.war dzhu27@web3.jhuep.com:/usr/local/tomcat/webapps/zhu_d_hw8.war

class server link:
https://web3.jhuep.com/zhu_d_hw8/MyServlet 


index.html: A simple HTML page that redirects to the servlet.

web.xml: Configuration for the servlet mapping.

MyServlet.java: Processes the form submission, delegates business logic, and forwards requests to JSPs.

FormData.java: A JavaBean that stores form data.

BusinessLogic.java: Contains the business logic to calculate the cost of the hike.

form.jsp: Displays the form for user input.

result.jsp: Displays the results after processing the form submission.


This setup ensures a clear separation of concerns, 
with the servlet acting as a controller, 
JSPs handling the view, and POJOs handling the business logic.
